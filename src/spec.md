# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page, responsive marketing landing page for DirectSell.AI that explains the product and teaches users how to use AI to reach potential customers.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single responsive landing page with all-English marketing copy and a coherent visual theme (avoiding blue/purple as primary colors).
- Add top navigation with anchor links to page sections and a hero section with product name, one-sentence value proposition, and a primary CTA that scrolls to “How it works”.
- Implement a “How it works” section with a clear 3–6 step flow and at least 3 copyable example outreach prompts/messages.
- Add supporting sections: key benefits/features (3–6 items), use cases (≥3 scenarios), FAQ (≥4 Q&As), and a footer with Privacy/Terms placeholders plus a short tagline.
- Add generated static brand visuals under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and reference them in the hero and/or navigation via static paths.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a polished DirectSell.AI landing page, understand who it’s for, and follow step-by-step guidance (with example prompts) to use the AI for customer outreach.
